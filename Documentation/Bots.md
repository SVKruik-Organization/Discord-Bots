# Bot Purposes

Like with the [first](https://github.com/SVKruik/Discord-Bots-v1/tree/main/Bot%20Files) generation of Discord bots, this project als features a couple of bots. Below I will explain each bot's purpose, and some 'lore' if that is what you can call it. In contrast to the first generation, I no longer have separate bots for different purposes. Apricaria and Stelleri ship with the full feature set I have developed over the passed few years.

#### Apricaria

[Apricaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_golden_plover) is the flagship bot of this project, fitted for production and public use. Apricaria is the endpoint of third party integrations like the [website](https://github.com/SVKruik-Organization/SK-Platform) and the SK Commander [application](https://github.com/SVKruik-Organization/SK-Commander). She contains the production version of some of commands and is thoroughly tested to provide optimal and reliable performance. Apricaria was first added in version [v2.2.0](https://github.com/SVKruik-Organization/SK-Bots/releases/tag/v2.2.0), but with a different name and purpose: Virgo, the trading bot. After a while I let the idea of the trading bot go, and fully retro-fitted Virgo to become the production and public variant of Stelleri. The rename from Virgo to Apricaria happened after someone confused the name with the Astrology sign, but it was meant to be the [Demoiselle crane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoiselle_crane). One of the key features separating Apricaria from Stelleri is that she supports Global commands, denoted by the `Supports Commands` badge shown on her profile. Because of the dependence of other applications, it is crucial that Apricaria has flawless uptime. Apricaria is the [Ciconia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_stork) version of the first generation of Discord bots.

#### Interpres

[Interpres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruddy_turnstone) is the newest addition to the lineup. She is the first specialized bot since this project, and her job is managing the development process through use of the GitHub and Discord API. She will send notifications when things get updated, and will be an interface for interactions with the project & repositories. For now, Interpres is reserved for personal use only and will not be made public like Apricaria. At the time of writing this, not much is built yet and I will expand this paragraph later on.

#### Stelleri

 [Stelleri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steller%27s_eider) is the testing version of Apricaria. I develop and test on Stelleri before syncing to Apricaria. Stelleri only works in non-production servers and only supports Guild commands. Before introducing Apricaria, she was the main bot that I deployed in other servers (academic projects), but it needed quite some expansions before being ready for the world. The [second](https://github.com/SVKruik-Organization/SK-Bots/commit/85b593a4da0f2aeb790ebf2144af74f56a25b314) commit on this repository was Stelleri being added, as I started from Ciconia, the former main bot. Stelleri is the [Hirundo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pied-winged_swallow) version of the first generation of Discord bots.

#### Virgo (deprecated)

[Virgo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoiselle_crane) was a planned trading bot. At the time of creation, I was inspired by another crypto/gold trading bot so I started research in that field. I also had experience with a non-crypto/gold trading bot called [Luscinia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrush_nightingale) from generation one. Luscinia was quite the peculiar little bot, and featured some market dynamics and interesting interactions. I had Virgo setup and ready to work on, but Stelleri got priority and I because of highly limited resources I did not have the time to develop two different bots. Also, my hype faded away for making a trading bot, so I focused Stelleri and Apricaria. Maybe some day in the future!

If you read all of that, thank you! You now know have a little background information on the bots part of the Discord bot project.
